	Middleware that sets REMOTE_ADDR based on HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, if the

	Note that this does NOT validate HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR. If you're not behind
	a reverse proxy that sets HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR automatically, do not use
	this middleware. Anybody can spoof the value of HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, and
	because this sets REMOTE_ADDR based on HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, that means
	anybody can "fake" their IP address. Only use this when you can absolutely
	trust the value of HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR.

	The code is from Django 1.0, but removed as unfit for general use.
